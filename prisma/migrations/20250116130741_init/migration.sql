/*
  Warnings:

  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[reference]` on the table `Payment` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Changed the type of `status` on the `Payment` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Made the column `reference` on table `Payment` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Changed the type of `method` on the `Payment` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
